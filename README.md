# Web-Development-Project
Final project in the last month of web development (PHP, html, MySQL) class.

Student class registration system with basic interface modeled after design and function of Coursicle.
After login, takes input of student class history and school's dynamic schedule of class offerings, allows student to request courses with various search features, checking against course catalog for prerequisites and open seats. Does not allow for conflicting times.

All project files are treated as if stored in a single folder except for SQL files.
